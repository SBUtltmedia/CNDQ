I have successfully fixed all the PHP warnings related to the 'displayName' key. I have also identified and resolved a state management issue that was causing the "insufficient funds" error.

The entire backend negotiation flow has been re-tested and is now working correctly without any warnings or errors.

The project is now in a clean state, with a fully functional and verified backend.

Please let me know what you would like to do next.
