This is a game based on the requirements stated in Problem.md
For added gameplay, but also to make it easier to test, NPCs were recently introduced, but I do not believe they are functioning correctly. The are not supposed to submit "buy" requests but should respond to real playing character's (RPC) buy requests resulting in what I would like to be a rich UX negotiation phase where both NPC and RPC can accept or reject offers that they feel are not optimum. Everything should conform to Problem.md except "Sell" requests which should be handled by "Buy" only (you can dispute this)
I think the puppeteer scripts are woefully out of date, and no assumtions on DOM items existing should be made. 
Our curent goal is to have a complete, robust testing puppeteer  enviroment that plays through the game for 3 sessions with 1 NPCs of each skill, and 3 simulated RPCs.
The test should reset the game at the start each time. For now the testing can focus on "Admin Mode" which is the opposite of "Auto Advance Mode" where students can play the game without the admin/instructor needing to do anything. 
WCAG is important, and should be tested, but since both the play test as WCAG test should see all aspects of the game, hopefully a WCAG test can be contructed after we have a complete, robust play test puppeteer, and that WCAG test can be made modular so is maintainable as game dev continues.
