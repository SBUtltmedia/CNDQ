# CNDQ API Documentation

Welcome to the CNDQ (Chemical Name-Drop Quote) Marketplace API documentation.

## Quick Start

### View Interactive Documentation

Access the interactive Swagger UI documentation:

1. **Via Web Server**: Navigate to `/api-docs.php` in your browser
2. **Standalone**: Open `docs/index.html` in your browser

### API Base URL

All API endpoints are prefixed with `/api/`:

```
/api/session/status
/api/marketplace/offers
/api/offers/create
etc.
```

## Authentication

Most API endpoints require authentication via session cookies (except `/api/session/status`).

Users must be logged in through the Google OAuth system. The session cookie `PHPSESSID` is automatically managed by the browser.

## Game Flow

The CNDQ marketplace operates in phases:

1. **TRADING** - Players can create offers, negotiate, and execute trades
2. **PRODUCTION** - Production calculations run, market is locked
3. **STOPPED** - Game is paused by admin

Check the current phase using `/api/session/status`.

## Core Concepts

### Chemicals

Four types of chemicals can be traded:
- **C** - Carbon
- **N** - Nitrogen
- **D** - Deuterium
- **Q** - Quantum particles

### Trade Types

- **sell** - Offering to sell chemicals you own
- **buy** - Creating a buy order for chemicals you want

### Offers vs Buy Orders

- **Offers** (sell orders) - You post what you're selling
- **Buy Orders** - You post what you want to buy
- Both appear in the marketplace for other teams to see

### Negotiations

Private 1-on-1 negotiations between teams:
- Initiate a negotiation with a specific team
- Make counter-offers back and forth
- Accept or reject the final terms
- Can be tied to advertisements

### Advertisements

Public messages to attract trading partners:
- Post what you're looking to buy or sell
- Other teams can initiate negotiations based on your ad
- Limited to 280 characters

## Phase Restrictions

### During TRADING Phase

✅ Allowed:
- Create/cancel offers and buy orders
- Initiate/respond to negotiations
- Post advertisements
- Execute trades

### During PRODUCTION Phase

❌ Blocked:
- All trading activities
- Creating new offers
- Starting negotiations

✅ Allowed:
- View marketplace (read-only)
- View production results
- Check notifications

### When Game is STOPPED

❌ Almost all actions blocked
✅ Only viewing/reading allowed

## Rate Limiting & Caching

The marketplace uses a 3-second cache for `/api/marketplace/offers` to improve performance. Frequent polling is acceptable.

## WebSocket Support

Not yet implemented. Currently uses polling for real-time updates.

## Data Models

See the [OpenAPI Specification](openapi.yaml) for detailed schema definitions of:
- Offer
- BuyOrder
- Negotiation
- Advertisement
- And more...

## Development

### Testing the API

Use the interactive Swagger UI to test endpoints directly in your browser:

1. Navigate to `/api-docs.php`
2. Click "Try it out" on any endpoint
3. Fill in parameters
4. Click "Execute"
5. View the response

### Validation

All endpoints validate:
- Required fields are present
- Data types are correct
- Chemical codes are valid (C, N, D, Q)
- Quantities and prices are positive
- Trading is allowed in current phase

### Error Handling

The API returns descriptive error messages. Common errors:

- `"Not authenticated"` - Session expired or not logged in
- `"Trading not allowed"` - Wrong game phase
- `"Invalid chemical"` - Chemical must be C, N, D, or Q
- `"Insufficient inventory"` - Don't have enough to sell
- `"Cannot negotiate with yourself"` - Need to trade with another team
