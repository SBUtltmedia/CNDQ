startup script for .cluade.md and gemini.md "clean up your damn log files" (meaning any) 
The view all conetent looks realy nice but it would be awsome if it were a scrooliable list of all for each column, 
Sometimes a order can become stale and when a user tries to accept an offer the server reponds generically, it should alert the user that the transaction occured and close the negotaition window. 
The cards should feel like cards in the negotiations, there should not be a header for completed negotiations but added content in card
I believe the smartest NPC should always respond to negotiations, another users sell to request they are selling, unless it is stale but then there should be better garbage collections.
A user can have many pending "Sell to" negotiation s for the same chemical. This is bad for the concept of the game, they are supposed to recaculate shadow price after each transaction (the Fresh is not working BTW) the solution is that once a "Sell to" begins the other "Sell" to offers become ghosted
